                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>In 2018 almost every single freelance project I started either involved cryptocurrency or America's newly emerging marijuana market. So many different companies started their own ICOs with their own idea of how blockchain could change the world, BitBloq planned to step forward and become the go-to crypto social media platform. Eventually the final, unexpected Bitcoin crash in November also crushed most ICOs which unfortunately included BitBloq.</p>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>BitBloq planned for a staggered ICO which would alleviate compute costs and somewhat mitigate inflation of their coin. With the planned staggering, I created a static ICO website using React and Gatsby.js. The actualy app interface was built seperate and required incoming API requests, apparently done so that the app could create an orderly queue and batch transaction requests without having a heavy compute cost. The obvious issue would be that the main website is rendered as static HTML, falling on myself to either find a solution that allowed an API to be initiated from a static source without blowing up compute costs or create an intermediary application that acted as a handler between the site and transaction app.</p>
                <p>The key goal was to keep compute costs low, BitBloq was going into their ICO with start-up level investments and having to pay for not only the ICO but to operate their actual marketplace stack. Mismanaged, their ICO could bankrupt them rather than fulfilling its actual purpose of generating investors.</p>
                <h3>Research and Development</h3>
                <h4>React Hydration</h4>
                <p>This was the first major project I used React and Gatbsy.js with (note that Gatsby.js was more of a generator utility rather than a framework at the time) and I had determined that "rehydration" of forms / api componenets could be a feasible option. Hydration is a React concept where a server generated static HTML site is actively modified by server-side React calls allowing for app-like functionality within the static site. While this is a phenomenal function I found there was a discrepency on the data the rehydration was providing to the server. It seemed as though the investor information would bind itself to the wrong API call and at the time the Gatsby forums were lit up with posts about the "React Hydration issue".</p>
                <p>There was a discrepency between the time it took for the server side API to generate and fire in tandem with the client side's API call to the server. This was late October and Bitcoin was peaking we decided to stop wasting time resolving this issue and to sprint towards a rapid launch.</p>
                <p>Note: The launch of React 16.8 solved the above issue with React Hooks. The data provided during hydration could easily be wrapped with a paired API call.</p>
                <h4>Ajax Handler</h4>
                <p>At the end of the day we opted for the simplest yet most contentious-amongst-staff option, using vanilla JavaScript. After Gatsby would generate the static HTML pages, a server-side script would inject a small Ajax JS handler into the page. It was a quick and easy solution that worked perfectly even though it didn't render server-side.</p>
                <h3>Tech</h3>
                <h4>Languages / Frameworks / Platforms</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>AWS</p></li>
                    <li><p>Ethereum Server</p></li>

                </ul>
                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>BitBloq was well organized. The leadership team came from various branches of tech and knew what it took to keep a project moving. Our project management tools included Asana and Bitbucket.</p>
